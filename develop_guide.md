## DATA

- Better handling for the different options of data status (avoid redowloading if its already dowloaded, ...)

### CIC-IDS2017

- Problem: If the dataset is already loaded with a configuration, loading another with a different configuration (without deleting the previous) will end in an error, since it tries to concat also the data in the already processed on (previous configuration)

- Data analysis
    - Visualization of missing values
    - Outliers analysis?
