## DATA

### CIC-IDS2017

- Dealing with missing values and infinite values. Needs solving
- Visualization of missing values
- nan class? -> doing the mapping of attack might be a good option

- Data analysis
    - Outliers analysis?

- Extended dataset? Avoided bacause it needs futher processing before applying PCA

## MODELS

## PIPELINE ??
Contains code to integrate data and models, and others ? 

## IMPLEMENTATION / Notebooks?

- Preparing data for models
    - Binarizing
    - Splitting into train and test, and balancing classes
